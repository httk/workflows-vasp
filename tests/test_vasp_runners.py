"""The packaged VASP workflow directories, driven end to end through the real manager.

Ported from httk-workflow's ``tests/test_vasp_runners.py`` (``git show
15b0b36:tests/test_vasp_runners.py``), now that the four workflows live here as
package directories instead of built-in registrations. A fake ``vasp`` writes
plausible OSZICAR, OUTCAR, CONTCAR, and ``vasprun.xml`` files, and one variant of
it fails once with a diagnosable ``ZPOTRF`` error before succeeding, which is
what exercises the remedy ladder. Nothing here simulates the workflow protocol:
every test submits a real job to a real workspace and lets a real
:class:`httk.workflow.TaskManager` run it, resolving the runner straight from
this repository's package directories with
:func:`httk.workflow.scaffold.new_job` — the same call a deployment makes with
``--workflow-dir``.

Dropped: ``test_the_installed_package_form_resolves_the_packaged_runner``. It
exercised the reserved ``pkg:`` reference for a *pip-installed* runner package,
which does not apply to a package driven straight from its checkout directory
(a directory-sourced provider has no installed distribution to pin); the
``publish="workspace"`` path every other test already takes covers job
resolution and digest-pinning. ``test_every_packaged_runner_describes_itself_and_is_referenceable``
is folded into ``test_packages.py``, which already checks every package's
``--describe`` steps and workflow name against its manifest; the Bash/Python
parity this test also checked is covered more strongly below, by
``test_the_bash_runner_and_the_python_runner_publish_the_same_result``
comparing the entire job outcome rather than only the declared steps.
