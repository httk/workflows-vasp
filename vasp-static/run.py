"""One single-point VASP calculation of a structure that is already chosen.

The workflow is spelled out on the ``httk.codes.vasp`` primitives so that this
package directory is a starting point to copy and edit: ``prepare`` stages the structure and
the INCAR template ``templates/INCAR.static`` — the electronic settings of
``vasp-relax``'s ``INCAR.relax`` with the ionic loop switched off
(``NSW = 0``, ``IBRION = -1``) — and derives everything else, ``run`` executes
VASP with the reviewed remedy ladder, and ``publish`` publishes the result. The
structure may be a POSCAR or the CONTCAR of an earlier relaxation, staged as an
input file of this job and named by the ``poscar`` input.

Edit the template of a copied package to change the settings, or replace it in
a single job with a payload file ``files/INCAR.static``. The template's own
``EDIFF`` and ``EDIFFG`` are kept; when absent they are derived from
``accuracy_per_atom``. The ``incar_tags`` parameter wins over the template and
every derived value.

The job inputs and parameters are documented in this repository's README. Nothing
here imports anything but an installed *httk-workflow*, so this file and its
``templates/`` are the whole runner: it is the entry of this package directory,
reference it by git URI (e.g. ``git+https://github.com/httk/workflows-vasp#vasp-static``)
or with ``--workflow-dir`` (installed into the workspace first), or copy the package
directory and edit it. The runner file alone, without its ``templates/``, fails
with ``vasp.template_missing``. The template's ``ICHARG = 1`` becomes
``ICHARG = 2`` here, since a single point of its own has no charge density to
read.
